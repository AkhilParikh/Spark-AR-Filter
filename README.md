# Spark-AR-Filter

Spark AR Studio is an augmented reality platform for Mac & Windows that allows you to somewhat easily create AR effects for mobile cameras.

This filter is about the joker mask in which when you open your mouth the nose becomes big and its vice versa.

You just have to import in the Spark AR Studio.
